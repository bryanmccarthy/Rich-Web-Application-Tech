# Problem 3

Web application for querying user information from the Github API

endpoint: https://api.github.com/users

- The user of your application can input a username and search in Github
for that user’s information
- The information should be displayed as shown, including the avatar
picture at the top left
- The repo information can be obtained by following the “repos_url”. You
should implement a scrollable list to display these if the number exceeds
5
